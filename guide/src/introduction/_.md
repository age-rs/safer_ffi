# Introduction

> `safer_ffi` is a rust framework to generate a foreign function interface (or FFI) easily and safely.

This framework is primarily used to annotate rust functions and types to
generate C headers without polluting your rust code with
`unsafe`.

It's inspired by [`#[wasm_bindgen]`][wasm_bindgen]. It's mainly expose Rust to C
over the FFI (allowing C code calling into Rust code). However, it does have some
usages for C to Rust over the FFI (callbacks or `extern { ... }`
headers).

This chart shows the comparison of traditional FFI types vs ones using `safer_ffi`.
